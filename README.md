# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website made following the odin project html tutorial.
In this tutorial I've learned some basic html, including the boilerplate, basic text elements, and list elements.
I also learned how to add images and links to a website.

As I learn CSS I've been adding to the site to test out and practice new things.
